  ## Pragmatic Perspectives on Strategy, Analytics, and Salesforce

  This journal reflects how I think about modern organizations—through the intersection of business strategy and analytics, and how that intersection shapes how companies operate, scale, and compete.

  Rather than treating strategy, data, analytics, and CRM as isolated disciplines, the writing here explores how their interaction drives real outcomes: decisions leaders trust (or question), systems that scale (or quietly erode), and insights that compound value—or introduce risk—over time. Grounded in real-world consulting experience across analytics, data platforms, and Salesforce-based CRM systems, the focus is on practical, systems-level thinking that connects intent to execution and analysis to action.
