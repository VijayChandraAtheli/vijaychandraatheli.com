  ## Welcome to My Journal

  I'm Vijay Chandra Atheli, a business analyst and consultant specializing in Business Intelligence, Analytics, Data Strategy, and Salesforce solutions. This journal is where I share insights, perspectives, and lessons learned from working with organizations to transform their data capabilities and technology strategies.

  Through years of consulting experience, I've seen how the right approach to analytics and technology can fundamentally change how businesses operate and compete. My goal here is to distill those experiences into actionable insights that help others navigate the complex landscape of modern business intelligence and enterprise technology.

  Whether you're a fellow consultant, a business leader evaluating your analytics strategy, or a professional looking to deepen your understanding of these topics, I hope you find value in these perspectives.
