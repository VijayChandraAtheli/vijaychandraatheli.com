## Background

I'm a business analyst and consultant with expertise in Business Intelligence, Analytics, Data Strategy, and Salesforce implementations. My work focuses on helping organizations make better decisions through improved data capabilities and strategic technology adoption.

Over my career, I've worked with enterprises across various industries, helping them modernize their analytics infrastructure, implement robust data governance frameworks, and leverage platforms like Salesforce to drive business outcomes. I combine technical knowledge with strategic thinking to deliver solutions that are both innovative and practical.

My approach is grounded in the belief that technology is only valuable when it serves clear business objectives. Whether designing a new analytics platform, optimizing a Salesforce implementation, or developing a data strategy, I start by understanding the business context and work backward to the technical solution.

## What I Write About

### Business Intelligence & Analytics
I explore topics related to BI platforms, analytics tools, visualization strategies, and how organizations can build effective reporting and insights capabilities. My writing covers both strategic considerations (what tools to choose, how to organize analytics teams) and tactical insights (best practices, common pitfalls, emerging trends).

### Data Strategy & Architecture
Data architecture and governance are foundations for any successful analytics program. I write about designing scalable data infrastructures, implementing effective governance frameworks, and navigating the evolving landscape of the modern data stack.

### Salesforce
With extensive experience in Salesforce implementations and customizations, I share insights on CRM strategy, integration patterns, best practices for different Salesforce clouds, and how to maximize value from the platform.

### Consulting Insights
Beyond specific technologies, I write about the consulting profession itself—client engagement strategies, transformation methodologies, lessons learned from successful (and unsuccessful) projects, and observations about how organizations approach change.

## Approach & Philosophy

**Context Matters:** Every organization is different. Cookie-cutter solutions rarely work. I believe in understanding the specific context—business model, culture, constraints, goals—before recommending approaches.

**Pragmatism Over Perfection:** The perfect solution that never gets implemented helps no one. I favor pragmatic approaches that deliver value incrementally while maintaining a clear vision of the end state.

**Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven:** Data should inform decisions, not make them. Human judgment, domain expertise, and strategic thinking remain essential even in an age of advanced analytics.

**Continuous Learning:** Technology evolves rapidly. What worked two years ago may not work today. I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing what I discover along the way.

## Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow professionals, potential collaborators, and anyone working on interesting problems in analytics and technology.
