## A New Beginning

Over the last few years, through a mix of consulting work and hands-on analytics roles, I’ve started noticing recurring patterns in how organizations use (and misuse) data, technology, and systems. Some of these insights came from projects that worked well; others came from things that didn’t.

This journal is my way of slowing down, reflecting on those experiences, and making sense of what I’m learning — across Business Intelligence, Analytics, Data Strategy, and technology implementations — while I’m still very much in the process of growing.

## Why Write?

There are several reasons I'm starting this journal:

**Clarify My Thinking:** Writing forces precision. It's easy to have vague intuitions about what works and what doesn't. Writing requires turning those intuitions into clear, defensible arguments.

**Share Knowledge:** I've benefited immensely from the writing of others—colleagues, mentors, industry experts. This is my way of contributing back to the community that has taught me so much.

**Build Connections:** Some of the most valuable professional relationships I've formed started with shared ideas. If my writing resonates with you, I'd love to connect and learn from your experiences as well.

**Document the Journey:** The field of analytics and technology moves quickly. Looking back at what we thought was important, what challenges we faced, and how we approached them provides valuable perspective on how far we've come.

## What to Expect

This journal will cover four main areas:

### Business Intelligence & Analytics

I'll write about BI platforms, analytics strategies, reporting frameworks, and the organizational aspects of building effective analytics capabilities. Expect both strategic thinking (how to choose tools, structure teams, measure success) and tactical insights (specific techniques, common pitfalls, best practices).

### Data Strategy & Architecture

Topics here include data governance frameworks, modern data stack considerations, architectural patterns, and how to build scalable data infrastructure that serves both current needs and future growth.

### Salesforce

With extensive experience in Salesforce implementations, I'll share insights on CRM strategy, integration patterns, customization approaches, and how different organizations leverage various Salesforce clouds to drive business value.

### Consulting & Transformation

Beyond specific technologies, I'll reflect on the consulting profession itself—how to engage effectively with clients, manage complex transformations, navigate organizational politics, and deliver sustainable change.

## My Approach

A few principles guide my thinking and will inform what I write:

**Context Matters:** There are very few universal solutions. What works brilliantly for one organization may fail spectacularly for another. I'll always try to be explicit about context and constraints.

**Pragmatism Over Perfection:** The perfect solution that never gets implemented helps no one. I favor pragmatic approaches that deliver incremental value while maintaining strategic vision.

**Skepticism of Hype:** Our field is plagued by hype cycles. New tools and approaches are constantly marketed as revolutionary. I'll try to cut through the noise and focus on what actually delivers value.

**Continuous Learning:** I don't have all the answers. I'm still learning, still making mistakes, still refining my thinking. This journal is as much about my learning journey as it is about sharing knowledge.

## Looking Ahead

I'm planning to publish regularly—aiming for at least one substantial article every week or two. Some posts will be tactical and specific. Others will be more strategic and reflective. All will be grounded in real experience rather than abstract theory.

If you're working in analytics, considering a career in consulting, evaluating technology strategies, or simply curious about these topics, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Thank you for reading. Let's learn together.
